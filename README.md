## FAQ

### 1. Can _highlight_ have other colors added?

For now I just inclued four basic colors, Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow.  Others can of course be manually added to the list if you build you own version of this plugin.  I hope to someday add a color picker or just allow you to enter hex.

### 2. Is it free of charge?

Yes. See the license too!
